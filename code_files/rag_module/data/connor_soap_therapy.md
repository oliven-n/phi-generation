Assessment:

Based on today's session, it is clear that Connor has made significant progress in managing his depressive symptoms. The combination of psychoeducation on coping strategies and increased engagement in pleasurable activities seems to be contributing positively to his overall well-being. His affect, mood, and verbal expression have all improved, indicating a positive response to therapy. However, Connor's ongoing concerns regarding his sleep patterns warrant further exploration. His difficulty falling asleep and early morning awakenings may indicate the presence of underlying stressors, which need to be identified and addressed.



Plan:

Moving forward, we will continue to reinforce and build upon effective coping strategies, such as mindfulness and behavioral activation. Additional attention will be given to Connor's sleep disturbances. We will explore potential triggers and stressors contributing to these issues and provide psychoeducation on sleep hygiene and relaxation techniques. The development of additional relaxation techniques to address his sleep concerns will also be considered. Connor's progress thus far is promising, and continued therapy sessions will aim to further improve his mood, manage his depressive symptoms, and address his sleep concerns.
