      "During the session, the client, Connor, reported a significant improvement in his overall mood since our last meeting. He has been consistently utilizing coping mechanisms that were previously discussed and has been making an effort to engage in activities that he once found enjoyable. He expressed that his depressive symptoms have decreased in both intensity and frequency. Additionally, Connor mentioned a recent family gathering where he felt more engaged and connected with his loved ones. This positive experience provided him with a sense of social support, which he believes contributed to his improved mood. However, Connor expressed ongoing concerns about his sleep patterns, noting occasional difficulty falling asleep and early awakenings.\n",

He actively participated in the session, showing improved eye contact and verbal expression. His body language suggested a decrease in overall tension compared to previous sessions. Connor's energy levels have improved, and he reported engaging in physical activities such as walking and jogging on a regular basis.

The combination of psychoeducation on coping strategies and increased engagement in pleasurable activities seems to be contributing positively to his overall well-being. His affect, mood, and verbal expression have all improved, indicating a positive response to therapy. However, Connor's ongoing concerns regarding his sleep patterns warrant further exploration. His difficulty falling asleep and early morning awakenings may indicate the presence of underlying stressors, which need to be identified and addressed.\n",

      "Plan:\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving forward, we will continue to reinforce and build upon effective coping strategies, such as mindfulness and behavioral activation. Additional attention will be given to Connor's sleep disturbances. We will explore potential triggers and stressors contributing to these issues and provide psychoeducation on sleep hygiene and relaxation techniques. The development of additional relaxation techniques to address his sleep concerns will also be considered. Connor's progress thus far is promising, and continued therapy sessions will aim to further improve his mood, manage his depressive symptoms, and address his sleep concerns.\n",

      "Abstract\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2013, electronic documentation of clinical care stands at a crossroads. The benefits of creating digital notes are at risk of being overwhelmed by the inclusion of easily importable detail. Providers are the primary authors of encounters with patients. We must document clearly our understanding of patients and our communication with them and our colleagues. We want to document efficiently to meet without exceeding documentation guidelines. We copy and paste documentation, because it not only simplifies the documentation process generally, but also supports meeting coding and regulatory requirements specifically. Since the primary goal of our profession is to spend as much time as possible listening to, understanding and helping patients, clinicians need information technology to make electronic documentation easier, not harder. At the same time, there should be reasonable restrictions on the use of copy and paste to limit the growing challenge of ‘note bloat’. We must find the right balance between ease of use and thoughtless documentation. The guiding principles in this document may be used to launch an interdisciplinary dialogue that promotes useful and necessary documentation that best facilitates efficient information capture and effective display.\n",
      "\n",
      "Keywords: Clinical documentation, inpatient clinical notes, documentation process, information capture, SOAP, APSO note, copy-paste, note bloat\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary Recommendations The members of the Association of Medical Directors of Information Systems (AMDIS) propose guiding principles for electronic documentation and present best-practice recommendations for inpatient Electronic Health Records (EHR) clinical documentation. Notes should primarily serve the core needs of patients and health care providers and secondarily meet the needs of other key stakeholders such as clinical researchers, public health agencies, health insurers and legal entities. The goals of best documentation practices are to: forge an accurate, logical, concise, cohesive and secure record of each patient’s narrative and health data; improve individual health outcomes by supporting effective clinical decision support; ensure that documentation meets regulatory and payment guidelines; and, continuously improve quality, safety and population health outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "We describe a note format modified from the traditional SOAP note (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), called APSO (Assessment, Plan, Subjective, Objective). Providers first look for the diagnosis and treatment portion of the note. APSO places them at the beginning of the note, making provider search faster. We highlight the need to measure the quality of electronic notes. We emphasize that digital documentation will realize its full potential when, buttressed by seamless decision support, it becomes the primary platform for quality of care evaluation and improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "We close with recommendations for our care provider and informatics colleagues. We strongly recommend that providers replace inefficient or dangerous documentation habits with behaviors that optimize the use of current and evolving EHR functionality. We encourage our colleagues to promote an electronic documentation platform for individual and population health improvement unmatched by the pen-and-paper capabilities of prior centuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Documentation of medical care may date back as far as the Egyptians in the time of Imhotep [1, 2]. Over the centuries, the transformation of medicine has been profound. In the last century, medical documentation has moved from simply documenting medical care received by the patient to one that supports communication among providers and a rationale for decision-making, payment, quality and outcomes measurement, and legal defense. Documentation of patient encounters by providers has followed time-honored and largely evidence-free traditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fifty years ago, an operative note for removing an appendix might be simply “After satisfactory induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, a McBurney incision was made and an acutely inflamed, non-ruptured appendix was removed.” [Personal communication: LO] To meet the needs of the multiple purposes that medical documentation now serves, that note has expanded in both length and breadth.\n",

      "One of the unintended consequences of electronic documentation is the ability to easily incorporate large volumes of data into clinical documentation. The use of inappropriate computer-aided data entry (auto-filling) increases the risk of data-filled, information-poor notes. These data-filled notes risk overloading the busy clinician if the data are not useful and risk harming the patient if the data are wrong. As a result, there is an urgent need to make the most clinically relevant data in the medical record easier to find and more rapidly available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rationale, Goals and Scope\n",
      "\n",
      "The many benefits of electronic documentation – legibility, accessibility, robust content, simultaneous availability, and efficiency – are challenged by the proliferation of redundant content that often detracts from readability, ultimately diminishing and even jeopardizing the communication for which notes are intended [3]. Supporting technology, like “copy and paste”, can further detract from the ease of interpreting and identifying pertinent content. This “note bloat”, expansion of a note’s length and complexity due to a marked increase in copied content, introduces the risk of misinterpreting key clinical data with potentially negative consequences for patient safety and provider workflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors, like most active clinicians in the U.S.A, learned documentation from leading proponents of organized medical records (the paper-based, pre-digital term), and use Dr. Larry Weed’s SOAP format [4]. Many clinicians also learned undesirable documentation habits in the paper era that we perpetuate in the electronic era. The goal of this consensus statement is to develop for and disseminate to the health information technology (HIT) and clinical care communities a practical, actionable document identifying important considerations, best practices, key recommendations for documenting in the EHR, and areas for future study. We focus on the documentation of inpatient encounters by physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. In future articles, we plan to build upon the shared principles and features to address documentation in ambulatory, rehabilitation and skilled nursing facility settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guiding Principles\n",
      "\n",
      "EHR documentation has become a flash point for controversy in several areas. In billing there have been allegations of fraud being made by payers [32]. Senators have raised concerns about the impact of meaningful use incentives [33]. There is a new focus on meeting the “triple aim”: better individual care, better population health, and lower costs. No two healthcare organizations are exactly the same and no two providers are alike. And yet, there are key principles which we believe will help guide clinicians toward effective and efficient electronic notes documentation.\n",

      "\n",
      "Documenting provider, covering provider, consulting provider: Providers want to treat patients to the best of their ability and do so in the most time-efficient manner. Software supporting clinical documentation should be configurable to the type of provider (specialty, training) and context (admitting, consulting) and automatically attribute information to each author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Team members in the many environments where patients are now managed by teams\n",
      "\n",
      "Patient, patient surrogate or caregiver: Patients, and those acting on their behalf, want to know that the patient's record is of the highest quality, complete and reflects provider communication.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regulator, Department of Public Health, Accreditation Agency, Safety and Risk Management Entity: Regulators and others look for consistent implementation of policies and errors of both omission and commission. Questions often pursued include: did events happen when they were \"supposed\" to happen, such as antibiotic or anticoagulation administration? Did a so-called \"never-event\" occur, such as wrong-limb surgery? Was recorded care accurately reflected in the charge coding, without simple errors such as an errant digit in a code?\n",
      "\n",
      "Legal counsel, court, jury: The medical record is the legal record. The digital form also includes “meta-data” (such as date and time stamps) and audit trail information that didn’t exist in the legal paper record. Attorneys want to see the meta-data to determine when information was available and whether it was acted upon in a timely fashion (“eDiscovery”). The courts attempt to infer diagnostic and therapeutic intent from the record.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researcher: Researchers want to find ways to improve care for a cohort of patients. Electronic documentation provides new opportunities to perform this research. Natural language processing (NLP) can be used to infer information from free text. Aggregate de-identified information from individual patient data may reassure the public that privacy risks are minimized.\n",
      "\n",
      "Payer, payer agent, governmental auditor: Payers expect the documentation to support the care that was rendered and billed. Auto-filling of documentation or non-attributed copy-pasting, raises concern by EHR auditors when they see the same verbiage and elements of a review of systems or examination for many patients, even though each patient presents with different symptoms or conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supporting data integrity and quality\n",
      "\n",
      "Electronic documentation systems should allow data to be entered once by an author and used by other authors (by reference, not as a copy) based upon clinical and professional practice needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "When specific elements of the same patient’s prior notes do not change from one encounter to the next during the same clinical episode, those elements may be copied forward or preferably acknowledged by reference rather than re-entered.\n",
      "\n",
      "When copying elements of the subjective information or history, the user acknowledges the source and modify the information to reflect the differences from prior notes. When copying into one’s own note, the author marks those sections as having been reviewed by the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "Examples of information that is less controversially copied or carried forward by reference – when truly needed to communicate decision-making for the active encounter – include elements of the previously recorded:\n",

      "\n",
      "Ensuring Privacy and Security It is the duty of each facility and provider to keep all patient information private and secure. The record should only be released to those for whom permission has been granted by the patient or the patient’s legally recognized representative, and should be protected both physically and digitally in a manner consistent with the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).\n",
      "\n",
      "Note Formats and Copy-Paste / -Forward\n",
      "\n",
      "SOAP vs. APSO\n",
      "\n",
      "The most commonly used progress note format has been the SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) note, originally promoted by Dr. Weed [4] as part of the Problem-Oriented Medical Record. The POMR includes an updatable master Problem List, an Allergy/Intolerance List, and a Medication List. In the digital environment – especially with note-bloat – finding the information most pertinent to the clinician, the Assessment and Plan, often requires scrolling or clicking through lengthy supporting and sometimes irrelevant data.\n",
      "\n",
      "To speed access to the Assessment and Plan, some clinicians have proposed altering the SOAP sequence to APSO (Assessment / Plan / Subjective / Objective). The APSO vs. SOAP debate arises from reduced satisfaction with the clinical note as its length has increased, in part due to misuse of “copy-paste” functionality. Advantages and disadvantages of SOAP, APSO and Copy-Paste /-Forward are presented below. We recommend that both SOAP and APSO formats be a configurable option by individual preference.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOAP\n",
      "\n",
      "Benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "SOAP is the traditional, familiar format used when most providers talk to patients and subsequently construct their notes. Documentation in this format follows the traditional flow of obtaining information from and subsequently assessing a patient. Subjective and interim information is communicated at the beginning of the note, providing context for the Assessment and Plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "The information which clinicians most often seek – the Assessment and Plan – is at the end of the documentation, requiring clicks or scrolling to find, potentially delaying and sometimes frustrating the clinician, especially with increasingly lengthy notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "APSO\n",
      "\n",
      "Benefits\n",
      "\n",
      "APSO presents the information generally most relevant to ongoing care at the beginning of the note, where it can be most quickly found, shortening the time required for the clinician to find each colleague’s Assessment and Plan [5]. Having the Assessment and Plan at the beginning of the document stresses its importance, and may induce a greater effort to provide a complete, clear, and concise representation of diagnostic and therapeutic thoughts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Risks\n",
      "\n",
      "APSO is a less familiar format and may require a period of adjustment. Having the Assessment and Plan at the beginning of the note might lead to less clear communication. Not reading the supporting subjective and objective findings placed lower in the note may induce medical errors. It has been suggested that the APSO format may not decrease note bloat, since there is no incentive to decrease the Subjective and Objective parts of the note if those sections follow the Assessment and Plan and readers of an APSO note might stop reading the note after the Assessment and Plan. A succinct APSO note requires the same training and cultural adaptation as a SOAP note, whether recorded as SOAP and transformed to APSO by EHR functionality or initially entered in the APSO format. The re-ordering into APSO is only an effort to streamline communication, not to eliminate the vital relationship of S to O to A to P.\n",
      "\n",
      "Copy-Paste and Copy-Forward\n",
      "\n",
      "Errors in using copy-paste occur frequently, e.g. when the 75 year-old gentlemen suddenly becomes a 30 year-old woman! The seduction of avoiding repetitive typing of HPI or review of systems sometimes results in monotonous documents, making them time-inefficient or clinically meaningless to the reviewing clinician [6] and potentially harmful to the patient.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, 'copy-paste' functionality or user-directed insertion of previously finalized data often results in regurgitated data that does not successfully identify the pertinent Subjective or Objective information that constitutes an effective SOAP note [7-10]. It is important to emphasize that copy-paste can be just as much a hindrance to supporting effective communication as it may be a help to clinicians completing their documentation[11]. Its judicious use enables creating a better note to support communication among care providers (Guiding Principle 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "Finding the proper balance is essential. Despite the dangers of copy-paste in some circumstances, there is clear value in having the computer do menial work assisting the clinician with documentation. Effective copy-paste should be limited to specific circumstances (Guiding Principles 3). As much as possible, “copy” should be performed by reference rather than by creating an actual copy in the record.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, to reference a consultant’s recommendation in another provider’s note, it should be possible to highlight the relevant section in the original note and identify that section as being incorporated into the new note using a standard method, differentiating copy-pasted material from directly entered material. This display might take the form of different colors or fonts, or mirror common publishing conventions with indentation for quotation. Similarly, the daily progress note need not reproduce all the patient events of the day through copy-paste. Adding to the daily note an “events of the last 24 hours” section – which can be toggled to display or hide – and then allowing these events to be displayed in sequence in a single view might provide the relevant information without redundancy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assessing the Quality of Documentation\n",
      "\n",
      "Defining what constitutes a high-quality note remains a challenge [14]. While EHR adoption has grown and everyone applauds the universal legibility of electronic notes, new problems including copy-paste, ‘note bloat’, ‘boilerplate,’ and clinical plagiarism [15] – risk subverting the readability and functional usability of electronic notes. Aligning visit documentation with optimized billing specifications has threatened the use of notes to promote effective communication among providers and patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "These concerns have prompted studies of note quality. Rosenbloom [16] proposed that note quality should be judged on the basis of legibility, accuracy, thoroughness, and compliance with administrative documentation standards. Alternative models of quality have been proposed by AMIA, HIMSS, AHIMA and other informaticians [17-21]. Stetson [22] validated the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument that measures note quality by these dimensions: up-to-date, accurate, thorough, useful, organized, comprehensible, succinct, synthesized and internally consistent. He recommends adding measures of “originality” to succinctness and internal consistency in order to improve detection of inappropriate copy-paste. Audit tools to assess the readability of notes have been developed at the Universities of Wisconsin and Colorado [Personal communication: WB]. This preliminary work requires further validation at multiple institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among payers, Medicare has begun to define what a quality note is not. First Coast Service Options, a CMS Medicare contractor, notified providers in a 2006 Medicare Part B newsletter that information cloning is prohibited and would be cause for payment denial. They defined cloning as “each entry in the medical record for a beneficiary is worded exactly like or similar to the previous entries,” or “when medical documentation is exactly the same from beneficiary to beneficiary [15].”\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to parameters of quality, notes must be composed in such a way that they are consistent with and can support decision support and research, as well as patient care [23]. The manner in which EHR information is presented, the function of the user interface, and the definition of the user experience, affects the ability of clinicians to effectively use informatics tools to support these purposes [24].\n",
      "\n",
      "Free text in the EHR has been demonstrated to be a viable source of information for health care quality reporting [25]. The variability of documentation habits in this less structured format makes quality measurement more difficult [26]. As Natural Language Processing (NLP) improves, the challenges associated with free text may diminish and the ability to assess the quality of free text components of a note should increase.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, in the era of Meaningful Use, rapid acquisition and implementation of commercial EHR systems and health information exchanges throughout the country create an opportunity to assess healthcare safety and quality indicators as never before [27].The clinical need to “tell the story” has challenged these efforts in American HIT to date. With higher-quality electronic notes and comprehensive, elegant methods to capture documentation in a structured and machine-readable manner [28-31], electronic notes can serve multiple needs, from communication to payment and research. Driving a consensus on electronic note quality through improved provider documentation behaviors and note quality measurement will enable us to balance care quality and coordination with payment and regulatory compliance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations to Colleagues\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve higher-quality clinician documentation, we recommend that:\n",
      "\n",
